### What is ADB?
ADB, or **Android Debug Bridge**, is a versatile command-line tool that allows developers and advanced users to communicate with an Android device. It can be used to 

- **Mirroring the screen**: Display your Android device's screen on your computer.
- **Installing and uninstalling apps**: Push or remove applications directly from your computer.
- **Accessing logs**: Retrieve system logs for debugging purposes.
- **File transfer**: Move files between your computer and the device.
- **Running shell commands**: Execute commands directly on the device.
- **others**

### How Does ADB Work?
ADB works by establishing a connection between your computer and the Android device. Hereâ€™s how it functions in both USB and wireless modes:

1. **USB Mode**:
   - The device is connected to the computer via a USB cable.
   - ADB communicates with the device through the USB interface.
   - This method is reliable but limits mobility due to the physical connection.

2. **Wireless Mode**:
   - The device and computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
   - ADB communicates over the network, eliminating the need for a USB cable.
   - This method offers greater flexibility, allowing you to control your device from anywhere within the network range.

## WADBD
This is a simple module which simplifies the process of enabling wireless ADB on any Android device. It provides two interfaces for enabling wireless ADB:

## KernelSU WebUI :
   - A web ui that allows you to enable wireless ADB for current session or on boot with just few clicks 
   - No need for terminal commands or technical expertise.
